This script processes trimmed (w/o primers) sequences through the [DADA2
(1.18) pipeline](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html).

# Install and load DADA2 and Shortread from Bioconductor

uncomment (remove the \#’s preceding each line of code) the following
code to install the required packages. This may take a few minutes.

``` r

    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("dada2", version = '3.14')
```

    ## Bioconductor version 3.14 (BiocManager 1.30.16), R 4.1.2 (2021-11-01)

# Import data

You will need to download your sequences from the [shared google
drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kmLhML2Sanv0gE8RnxpcyNEcrhan-Q2h?usp=sharing)
to a folder in your repository. Because this folder will then contain a
lot of data (over the limit for pushing to the GitHub server), you’ll
want to have your commits ignore the addition and any changes to that
folder. THIS IS IMPORTANT. You can modify the .gitignore file in your
repository by:

\-clicking on the .gitignore file to open it in R Studio if you can see
it in the “Files” tab of RStudio (the bottom right pane where you can
navigate around inside your 144L repository)

OR by:  
\- revealing hidden files (command + shift + . on a mac and in
[windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028316/windows-view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10),
open *file explorer*, select *view \> options \> change folder* and
*search options*, select *view* and in *advanced setting*, select *show
hidden files, folders, and drives* ) - open the .gitignore file
(textedit on a mac and notepad in widows) - add the name of the folder
containing the fastq (sequence) files to the .gitignore file, save, and
close

``` r
#save the path to the directory with a COPY of your unzipped fastq files that you WILL work with. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ANOTHER DIRECTORY WITH THE FILES THAT YOU WILL NEVER DIRECTLY WORK WITH. 

path <- "~/Desktop/144l_students_2021/Input_Data/week 7/ACIDD_Remin_fastq/" #make sure there is no / at the end of the path
#also make sure there are no unzipped files in this directory

#store the names of fwd and rv files as lists
fnFs <- list.files(path, pattern = "_R1_001.fastq", full.names = TRUE)
fnRs <- list.files(path, pattern = "_R2_001.fastq", full.names = TRUE)
```

# Retrieve orientation of primers

This part stores all the orientations of the V4 514F-Y and 806RB primers
( [see Apprill et
al., 2015](http://www.int-res.com/articles/ame_oa/a075p129.pdf)), so
that we can look for them when we want to trim them out.

``` r
FWD = "GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA"
REV = "GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT"

#now store all orientations of fwd and rvs primers 
allOrients <- function(primer) {
  # Biostrings works w/ DNAString objects rather than character vectors
  require(Biostrings)
  dna <- DNAString(primer)
  orients <- c(Forward = dna, Complement = complement(dna), Reverse = reverse(dna), 
              RevComp = reverseComplement(dna))
  #Convert back to character vector
  return(sapply(orients, toString))
  }
  
#Store the fwd and rvs orientations separately 
FWD.orients <- allOrients(FWD)
REV.orients <- allOrients(REV)

#view the orientations of the primers
FWD.orients
```

    ##               Forward            Complement               Reverse 
    ## "GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA" "CACRGTCGKCGGCGCCATT" "AATGGCGCCGMCGACYGTG" 
    ##               RevComp 
    ## "TTACCGCGGCKGCTGRCAC"

``` r

    ##                RevComp

\#search for Primers

``` r
primerHits <- function(primer, fn) {
  #Counts number of reads in which the primer is found
  nhits <- vcountPattern(primer, sread(readFastq(fn)), fixed = FALSE)
  return(sum(nhits >0))
}
rbind(FWD.ForwardReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs[[1]]), 
      FWD.ReverseReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs[[1]]), 
      REV.ForwardReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs[[1]]), 
      REV.ReverseReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs[[1]]))
```

    ##                  Forward Complement Reverse RevComp
    ## FWD.ForwardReads       0          0       0       0
    ## FWD.ReverseReads       0          0       0       2
    ## REV.ForwardReads       0          0       0       3
    ## REV.ReverseReads       0          0       0       0

Q1: Why do we see primers in the reverse complement of FWD.ReverseReads
and REV.ForwardReads? What will we use to remove them later?

A1: Because the reads are long enough to get the primers. To remove
them, we can use cutadapt.

# Insepct read quality profiles

You should look at least some of the quality profiles to assess the
quality of the sequencing run.

## Forward reads

``` r
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[1:12])
```

    ## Warning: `guides(<scale> = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(<scale> =
    ## "none")` instead.

![](211108_DADA2_submission_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->
Q2: Where will we trim our forward reads, and why? A2:We trim our
forward reads at position 150 where the quality distribution crashes. We
trim our forward reads because it can help us to improve the algorithm
sensitivity to rare sequence variants. \# Reverse reads

``` r
plotQualityProfile(fnRs[1:12])
```

    ## Warning: `guides(<scale> = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(<scale> =
    ## "none")` instead.

Q3: How does the quality of the reverse reads compare to the forward
reads? Is the quality of these reads acceptable to continue through the
DADA2 pipeline? Why or why not? A3: Quality of reverse reads is poor in
quality compare to the forward reads.It is acceptable to continue
through the DADA2 pipeline. DADA2 can incorporate quality information
into its error model which makes the algorithm robust to lower sequence.
Q4: Where will we trim our reverse reads and why? A4: At position 150.
It is the position where the quality distribution crashes.

# Filtering and Trimming

``` r
#Get the sample names
#define the basename of the fnFs as the first part of each fastq file name until "_L"
#apply this to all samples
sample.names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(fnFs), "_L"), `[`, 1)
sample.names
```

#created a "filtered" folder in the working directory as a place to put all the new filtered fastQ files. 
filt_path <- file.path(path, "filtered")
#add the appropriate designation string to any new files made that will be put into the "filtered" folder
filtFs <- file.path(filt_path, paste0(sample.names, "_F_filt.fastq"))
filtRs <- file.path(filt_path, paste0(sample.names, "_R_filt.fastq"))
```

Below is the actual filtering step. We’re using standard filtering
parameters. 1. dada2 generally advises trimming the last few nucleotides
for weird sequencing errors that can pop up there. 2. maxEE is the max
number of expected errors (calculated from Q’s) to allow in each read.
This is a probability calculation. 3. minQ is threshold Q - and read
with a Q \< minQ after truncating reads get discarded. This isn’t that
important for 16S.

``` r
out <- filterAndTrim(fnFs, filtFs, fnRs, filtRs, truncLen = c(240, 150), maxN = 0, maxEE = c(2,2), truncQ = 2, rm.phix = TRUE, compress = TRUE)
#look at this output. This tells you how many reads were removed.

Q5: What does it mean if a base call (base pairs read by the sequencer)
is an “N”? Are we going to use sequences that contain N’s in the rest of
our workflow? Which part of the filterAndTrim function specifies how to
treat sequences with N’s in them? A5: If a base call is an “N”, it means
it is an null data. We are not going to use sequences contain N’s. “maxN
= 0” is used to treat sequences with N’s in them.

Q6: Based on the “out” table, what is the average percentage of our
reads that we retain (reads that did not get filtered out) going forward
in the pipeline?

A6: The average percent is 93%. \# Learn the error rates

``` r
errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, multithread = TRUE)
```

    ## 38678400 total bases in 161160 reads from 16 samples will be used for learning the error rates.

``` r
errR <- learnErrors(filtRs, multithread = TRUE)
```

    ## 24174000 total bases in 161160 reads from 16 samples will be used for learning the error rates.

This took \~20 seconds each on a 2021 MacBook Pro.

This dada2 algorithm makes use of a parametric error model (err) as
every amplicon dataset has a different set of error rates. This is what
dada2 is all about. The step creates the parameters for designating
unique sequences.

Each sequence has an x number of reads. dada2 uses the numbers of reads
per sequence as well as the q-score to build this model. This algorithm
assumes that your most abundant sequence is “real” (the true sequence
for a particular organism). There is a very high probability that it is.

What the algorithm does is look at each base pair of an individual
sequence and calculate the probability that the base pair is an error
based on the quality score of the read and the sequence of your most
abundant read. It also does this for the second most abundant sequence,
etc. etc. hence the message “convergence after x rounds” after running
the algorithm.

Q7: What is the relationship between quality score and error rate show
in the 2 plots above? A7: A reverse relationship. The actual error rates
are shown as the black points, and the black line represents the
estimated error rates. The red line shows the error rates expected under
the nominal definition of the q score, As qualiry increases, error rates
decreases.

# Dereplication

This is another big thing that dada2 does. It combines all identical
sequences into one unique sequence, keeping track of the number of
identical sequences.

``` r
derepFs <- derepFastq(filtFs, verbose = TRUE)
derepRs <- derepFastq(filtRs, verbose = TRUE)
# Name the derep-class objects by the sample names 
names(derepFs) <- sample.names
names(derepRs) <- sample.names
```

Q8: What percentage of the reverse reads in the ASH171-A0 sample were
unique?

A8: 93.7%

# Infer sequence variants

Apply the core dada2 sample inference algorithm to the dereplicated
data.

Infer the sequence variants in each sample, taking out the sequence
variants that have excessive error rates.

So here, we are applying the error models to the data. Before, the error
models were run using a subset of the data (parameterizing). Now, we’re
using the parameters of the model and applying it to the whole data set
to see which sequences are real and which are not.

``` r
dadaFs <- dada(derepFs, err = errF, multithread = TRUE)
```

merge the overlapping reads -\> this will also decrease the number of
sequence variants. If you above had hits of the reverse complement in
the FWD.ReverseReads and the REV.ForwardReads, you can trim here by
adding trimOverhang = T.

``` r
mergers <- mergePairs(dadaFs, derepFs, dadaRs, derepRs, verbose = TRUE, trimOverhang = T)
```

inspect the merged data frame from the first sample. this will output a
table. the numbers in the forward and reverse columns tell where those
sequences are in the dadaFs and dadaRs files.

``` r
head(mergers[[1]])
```
